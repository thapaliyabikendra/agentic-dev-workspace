# CCC-009: Background jobs

> Project-wide NFR baseline default. FRSs cite this CCC by ID rather than
> restating its content. An operation that needs to deviate from this
> baseline files the deviation as an ADR back-linked here via
> `related: [CCC-009]` in the ADR's frontmatter. Cross-cutting governance
> rule: STD / ADR / CCC / DEC discriminator in
> [`../../../sdlc/workflow/authoring-adr.md`](../../../sdlc/workflow/authoring-adr.md).

## Baseline

Background job defaults use ABP background workers or Hangfire (TBD — ABP
background workers / Hangfire; choice of scheduler, retry policy, and failure
handling to be fixed by the first FRS that introduces a background job).

## Deviation path

Operation-specific deviations are filed as ADRs (component-scoped under
`docs/<component>/adrs/`, or cross-component under `docs/shared/adrs/`).
Each deviation ADR carries `related: [CCC-009]` in its frontmatter and a
prose explanation of the override. The CCC baseline stays put; the ADR
captures the override.

## Stack-specific notes

*(Optional. Add when the baseline has UI-side, test-side, or infra-side
constraints distinct from the default stack scope.)*
